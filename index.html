               Hi! My name is Matthew Kiyoi. I am a 23 years old former Campus Minister with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship at UW, 
               but am originally from California! As a Californian I constantly miss the sun, good Mexican food (please, tell me I'm wrong...), 
               and wear sandals everywhere. When I am not working on a web development project or learning new technologies, I love to read, cook, 
               bake, and play Riot Game's new game Teamfight Tactics.
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <p>
                I am also passionate about relationships. The way to have deep friendships and great partnerships with coworkers is through having 
                meaningful conversations with these people. Although I personally hate small talk, I love to listen to people's stories and even debate
                about this like politics or fiath.
            </p>
